# flipkart-discount-filter 
This chrome extension adds a discount filter to Flipkart searches.

 

This extension provides a text box, "Discount Filter", at the end of all other filters. Enter the Discount(%) you want to filter the results on and press the "filter" button. It will dim all results at first, but then it will light up those results which are greater than entered %.
